		<p1>Salad in the City is an urban organic farming operation in Salt Lake City, Utah
		Head farmer and owner at Salad in the City co-owned and co-farmed at <a href="https://keepitrealvegetables.weebly.com">Keep It Real Vegetables</a> for 9 years before starting her solo venture. Salad in the City consists of 2 large gardens in the Salt Lake area. It's a major downsizing from the 11 gardens the Keep It Real Vegetables duo used to cultivate, but it's enough to keep her very busy and hundreds of pounds of organic produce flowing in from the field every week.

	<h2>The Rock Garden
	</h2>
		<p2>The largest and oldest of Salad in the City's gardens is named for the 
multitude of substancially large rocks due to it being a riverbed millions of years ago.
